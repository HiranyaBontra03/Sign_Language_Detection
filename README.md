# Sign_Language_Detection
This project is focused on real-time American Sign Language (ASL) gesture detection using computer vision and machine learning. It uses OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand tracking, and it leverages the power of the ResNet50 architecture for sign language recognition. 

Key Features:
Real-time ASL gesture recognition.
Translation of ASL gestures to text or speech.

Technologies and Libraries:
OpenCV for computer vision.
MediaPipe for hand tracking.
ResNet50 from Keras for sign language recognition.

Usage:
Capture ASL gestures by pressing 's' when running the code.
